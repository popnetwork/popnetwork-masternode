### Get the code

```
$ git clone https://github.com/popnetwork/popnetwork-masternode
$ cd popnetwork-masternode
$ npm install
```

### Run the app

```
$ npm start
```

### Watch the code

Restart the app automatically every time code changes. Useful during development.

```
$ npm run watch
```
### Package the app

Builds app binaries for Mac, Linux, and Windows.

```
$ npm run package
```

To build for one platform:

```
$ npm run package -- [platform] [options]
```

Where `[platform]` is `darwin`, `linux`, `win32`, or `all` (default).

The following optional arguments are available:

- `--sign` - Sign the application (Mac, Windows)
- `--package=[type]` - Package single output type.
   - `deb` - Debian package
   - `rpm` - RedHat package
   - `zip` - Linux zip file
   - `dmg` - Mac disk image
   - `exe` - Windows installer
   - `portable` - Windows portable app
   - `all` - All platforms (default)

Note: Even with the `--package` option, the auto-update files (.nupkg for Windows,
-darwin.zip for Mac) will always be produced.

#### Windows build notes

The Windows app can be packaged from **any** platform.

Note: Windows code signing only works from **Windows**, for now.

Note: To package the Windows app from non-Windows platforms,
[Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and [Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) need
to be installed. For example on Mac, first install
[XQuartz](http://www.xquartz.org/), then run:

```
brew install wine mono
```

(Requires the [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) package manager.)

#### Mac build notes

The Mac app can only be packaged from **macOS**.

#### Linux build notes

The Linux app can be packaged from **any** platform.

If packaging from Mac, install system dependencies with Homebrew by running:

```
npm run install-system-deps
```
