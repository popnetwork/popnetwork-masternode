[POP Network](https://thepopnetwork.org/?utm_source=github) is an ecosystem of blockchain and artificial intelligence applications built to power the streaming economy. Components include:
- **Masternode Torrent Network** for decentralized, peer-to-peer streaming
- **Superdelegated Proof-of-Stake** blockchain for ultra-fast transaction processing
- **Artificial Intelligence** content protection to defend the network from harmful material

**POP Network Masternodes** form a decentralized, peer-to-peer torrent network to store and stream all media on POP Network. Masternodes earn 35% of all POP Network block rewards for performing this critical service.

### Release Notes v0.2.3-alpha
- POP Network Masternode staking is available on testnet

### Release Notes v0.2.2-alpha
- POP Network Masternode is now available on Mac, Windows, and Linux

### Release Notes v0.2-alpha
- Added Embed feature. After uploading video content to POP Network, press `< >` on seeding content then copy/paste the available HTML code to web page for decentralized streaming.

### Release Notes v0.1-alpha
- This is Windows-only testnet software and should be treated as extremely experimental.
- Do not upload any mission critical content to testnet. There is no guarantee future versions of the Masternode will be backwards-compatible.
- It is not possible to earn POP Network Tokens (POP) for operating a Masternode on testnet.
- The purpose of this release is to demonstrate how easy operating a POP Masternode can be and thus demonstrate how easy it would be to earn crypto on the torrent network.
